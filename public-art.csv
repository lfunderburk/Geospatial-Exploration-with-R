221;The Salmon Wall was created as a means of fostering understanding between the Musqueam and Southlands communities. It was also envisioned as a process to encourage respect for the Musqueam people and their traditions in the non-Native community. The project was initiated by artist Alison Diesvelt who, together with the Southlands principal, identified Musqueam artist Debra Sparrow as a partner. Sparrow creates traditional weavings and indicated that she was interested in working on the community art piece. Out of community consultations and workshops, a mural was created with colours and patterns drawn from Musqueam visual traditions. Many community members participated in painting the school of salmon along the south wall near the main entrance and a community salmon barbecue was held to celebrate its completion. - Parks Board web site;Mural;In place;Southlands Elementary School;5351 Camosun Street;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=221;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/ac91582212d5be54768d0903ce4b1098;Vancouver School Board;Dunbar-Southlands;Front wall of school;"{""type"": ""Point"", ""coordinates"": [-123.197495, 49.237801]}";Dunbar-Southlands;This mural is a school of painted salmon, each one unique.;"167;168";Skai Fowler;1995

441;Monument For East Vancouver develops from a graffiti symbol that has circulated for several decades in East Vancouver.  It is a symbol that has circulated in largely provisional terms.  My idea was to formalize the symbol through scale and permanence.  Although its precise origins are not known, the symbol does date back to at least the late 1940s (according to the memory of some senior citizens), which is the beginning of the post 2nd World War period.  Its roots may be linked to the Catholic inscription of East Vancouver culture at that time, home as it was to many Italians, Greeks and Eastern Europeans.  Over the years, the symbol has been adopted as an emblem for East Vancouver as a whole but its appearance has generally been tentative rather than overt.  The lack of overtness is, I feel, symptomatic of the underlying meanings that the symbol expresses.  These meanings have to do with problems of injustice, inequality, subjugation and the trauma of poverty and acculturation, particularly as it relates to immigrant life.  My proposal is for a site that sits on a visually messy and peripheral site in East Vancouver.  The East Vancouver symbol is rendered as a 57 foot sculpture that lights up after dark, the word East and Van encircled by a cross delineation that seems to float all on its own.  The sculpture faces westward towards downtown, towards the centre.  It is an expression of hope and defiance.;Sculpture;In place;;Clark Drive at East 6th Avenue;Concrete, Steel, Aluminum, Impact Modified Acrylic, LED Illumination;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=441;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/8f4517d81ac15e21ef22e8ebe9bb1c69;City of Vancouver;Grandview-Woodland;North West Corner of Clark Drive;"{""type"": ""Point"", ""coordinates"": [-123.077613, 49.265426]}";Strathcona;Freestanding illuminated sculpture;3;Robert-Keziere;2010

445;"The work takes its title from a series of photographs I shot in Vancouver in 1977…which documented a series of ‘incorrectly’ assembled toy glider kits…I put the models together not with a view to having them fly correctly, but with an eye to their aesthetic value as purely abstract sculptural forms… Part of the challenge inherent in making these works was the very limited instrumental set from which I had to draw.

When I was asked to create a sculptural proposal for the entrance to Stanley Park, it occurred to me that it might be interesting to return to this work…and try to realize a large-scale version of one of these sculptures: to use the same very limited instrumental set with which anyone who has put together a toy glider would be familiar.

500;"A community-based mural involving numerous experienced mural painters working with the local community, this mural was designed to visually engage pedestrians, cyclists and drivers along the McLean Bike route in and out of the city. For this reason, we collectively decided on a theme of migration, most specifically, the daily migration of crows. The mural suggests the almost mythic presence that crows hold for the population of Vancouver, a bird that has an iconic status in the city. As well, this theme reflects the daily human migration of commuters. 
Artistically, my challenge was to retain a poetic balance between representation and an underlying abstraction, giving the work an overall harmony and animation. In each of my mural projects, a focus is in the integration of the various elements.

In coming up with the motifs, we incorporated about 40 large stencils, generated from small relief prints created in community sessions. This allowed for many individuals to take part, including three mentored youth. Elements are then repeated in differing combinations throughout. Some of the local architecture, including McLean Drive General Store, are referenced, and a large head of a crow in an aboriginal design respects the territory of Native peoples where this wall is located. Artists worked to integrate the upper wall, with the garden area and in particular, with the lower wall, which is made up a series of images from stencils and freehand of insects, plants and seed forms that are indigenous to the area. 
In all, forty-two people took part. The lower area of the mural was particularly well suited to youth participation, with some as young as three years old, and the oldest participant in his eighties.

Sea is: the west coast dream. Killer whales are chasing salmon around the Salish Sea. Kelp is flowing in the currents, maybe it is herring spawning season. Flounders down below are oblivious to another world above the surface. Cod are hiding amongst the rocks waiting for an easy meal. Life is transient, hardly still, even though we don't see it, branches are deliberately growing, underwater habitats are being bathed with the tide and water vapors rise into the atmosphere to fall far away. Happenings are all around us, ready to be re-discovered again and again. The broken circle of each design element refers to fragmented spindle whorl artifacts and the separations we see between these elements.

Creations in weaving have been passed down for countless generations.  The artists’ grandmother, Edna Grant, was taught to weave by her mother, who was taught by her mother, and so on. Her designs could be recognized up and down the coast.  Not unlike a crest, weaving designs symbolize lineage.  This is true in carving, weaving, painting, and dancing.

733;Groening’s quirky still lifes often include unlikely but not impossible juxtapositions.

Each of the thirty-five, 5 x 8- foot glass panels is a composition created in colour stages. The inside viewer (hospital community or patients and staff?) is/are able to examine objects in detail over a 35 foot, colour-changing walkway mural, while the public art viewer sees an expanded version as colour spectrums spanning up five floors.Culled from her collection of jewel-toned glass objects and augmented by flea market finds and borrowed treasures, this giant-sized still life creates a spectrum of colour that is projected into the building in the afternoon and glows at night in a building-sized lightbox. Like large photographic slides, the transparent panels are mounted to a series of glass walkways that make up one wall of the internal atrium.

Many will recognize this particular procedurally-generated animation as the computer program known as Game Of Life, which unfolds frame-by-frame through a simple set of rules that determines whether each pixel lights up, stays lit, turns off, or stays off based on the number of its neighbours which are lit.

The proximity of Queen Elizabeth Park focused this examination to expression of plant forms.The metaphor of undifferentiated cells allowing complex growth can be exended to the human and social spheres and to the opportunities presented by the dramatic change in the fabric of this neighbourhood.Two sides of the bronze sculpture are smooth planar sections terminating at the top in a point, while the third side is a rough, cast surface designed to retain an ancient-looking patina. The smooth surfaces present a calm and elegant facade to the viewer while the third side is seasoned with bright streaks of turquoise, purple and green sharing the warm brown surface.The viewer is able to engage in the two every different surfaces of the monolith in an intimage way due to scale.;Sculpture;In place;Parc Elise;4488 Cambie Street;Bronze;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=800;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/fa89761ffca89405a1492e9fcc32e7c6;Privately owned - Strata;RileyPark;Main entrance to building;"{""type"": ""Point"", ""coordinates"": [-123.114838, 49.245651]}";Riley Park;A 20-foot bold vertical bronze sculpture, reminiscent of natural plant forms.;614;;2018

Seeming to float in the vaulted space, the new artwork is viewable from multiple vantage points—from below on floor eight and from above and the sides on floor nine.The sculpture connects to the foreshores of the region: the boats used for trade, fishing, and connecting communities on these lands and waters since before recorded history, and the continuing significance of boats and travel to the histories, myths, and narratives told in cultures across the world.;"341;595";Henri Robideau;2019

808;“聚 Gathering” is a mural painting that celebrates diversity and the thriving intergenerational community in Chinatown.The site of this mural plays an important role of representing Chinese cultural heritage in Vancouver. Chinese Cultural Center (CCC) has been providing facilities and initiatives for language classes, exhibitions, and cultural performances etc since the 1920s. Not limited to only Chinese-speaking patrons, CCC is a safe space where those who love Chinese culture can share their interests and where young people or native-born Chinese can explore their roots. It is important to emphasize that Chinatown is not only for Chinese or tourists but a space that welcomes everyone to celebrate the beauty of diversity.When one generation passes their secret recipes or tell their life stories to the next generation, it is like passing down little pieces of cultural heritage. I hope the mural introduces a slice of Chinatown’s multicultural and intergenerational community in a fun and optimistic way.;Mural;In place;Chinese Cultural Center (CCC);555 Columbia Street;Paint and Oil based markers;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=808;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/0919392860628f7222d84b2603bacad3;Privately owned;DowntownEastside;Mural on a shutter door on Carrall St, facing the SUCCESS Senior Care Home;"{""type"": ""Point"", ""coordinates"": [-123.103282, 49.279756]}";Downtown;"The artwork is part of a series of murals in Chinatown, commissioned through the City's Chinatown Mural Artist Call 2019.

809;“Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea” is a familiar story from Chinese folklore about eight immortals crossing the East Sea differently with their special powers. The saying “eight immortals crossing the sea, each with their prowess” has become an allegory to describe how everyone has a unique way to complete the task. The eight immortals, in the context of migration, can be seen as representations and celebrations of diversity in all the individuals that make up the history of Vancouver’s Chinatown: those who have overcome difficulties, and those who have made contributions tothis community, each in their own way.We hope the mural, through its exploration of Chinese mythology in a local context, can act as a catalyst to re-imagine Vancouver’sChinatown, its history, and its people as the work re-interprets a traditional story in celebration of the real stories of the community members who shaped this neighbourhood. We also hope the depiction of a classic legend can spark conversations between generations, and provide an opportunity to bridge cultures.《⼋八仙過海海》是⼀一個廣為⼈人知的中國神話，講述了了⼋八位神仙各⾃自施展法⼒力力橫渡東海海的故事。由此故事發展出的諺語—「⼋八仙過海海，各顯神通」寓意每個⼈人都有其獨特的⽅方法去戰勝困難。重新詮釋的「⼋八仙」也象徵了了所有通過不不同⽅方式跨海海來來到這⽚片⼟土地，戰勝困難，為唐⼈人街社區做出貢獻的⼈人們。⼋八卦藝術家⼩小組嘗試⽤用壁畫形式呈現神話故事《⼋八仙過海海》，並傳遞其背後蘊藏的象徵意義。壁畫本身在溫哥華唐⼈人街獨特社區⽂文化的基礎上為唐⼈人街提供了了新的想像空間，為觀看者理理解唐⼈人街社區的歷歷史和社區成員提供了了新的內容。通過重新詮釋的《⼋八仙過海海》故事來來讚揚所有參參與建設唐⼈人街社區的個體和其⼈人⽣生經歷歷；同時可以為⻑⾧長者和⻘青少年年，華裔和⾮非華裔加拿⼤大⼈人之間的交流搭建橋樑。;Mural;In place;Liang You Bookstore;218 E Georgia St;Acrylic Latex Paint;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=809;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/238b9f208619e3b6a3329a99b6487249;City of Vancouver;DowntownEastside;Adjacent to the laneway;"{""type"": ""Point"", ""coordinates"": [-123.098962, 49.278296]}";Strathcona;This artwork is part of a series of murals in Chinatown, commissioned through the City's Chinatown Mural Artist Call 2019.

825;"""Inspired by Henry David Thoreau’s essay “Civil Disobedience” (1849), Wurm’s Big Disobedience, (2016) makes reference to an often explored theme: political and social correctness. Related in its use of the human form and apparel, Half Big Suit (2016) stems from an earlier series, Cut, that investigates the fragmented body. Fixed in an awkward position, with one leg extended in the air, the static sculpture conveys a sense of distress experienced while undergoing a durational performance or holding a lengthy pose. In their focus on the body and its motions, these works relateto Wurm’s famous One Minute Sculptures series (XXXX), in which viewers enact simple yet absurd poses for one minute at a time.The relationship between the organic transformation of the body through biological factors and the intentional moulding of objects in Wurm’s work is illustrated in his architectural structure, Flat Iron (2016). Here the artist’s distorted recreation of New York’s iconic Flatiron Building is demonstrated in a melting structure, demonstrating further how the manipulation of volume, scale, form and materiality, can signal transformation in both human and non-human form.Inspired by Wurm’s performative practice, the Gallery invited Mike Bourscheid, an artist who works between Luxembourg and Vancouver, to develop a series of performative interventions at Offsite: Erwin Wurm."" - Vancouver Art Gallery";Sculpture;In place;Shangri-la - Offsite;1128 West Georgia Street;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=825;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/606d7fbce6fee5aacda36d00722505a0;Privately owned;West End;West of Shangri-la Hotel (on W.

841;The public art Koco, Brewers Park, August 19, 2019 by Peter Gazendam is a single, significant sculpture orientated within the landscape architecture in a central, plaza-like location facing Stainsbury Avenue. The subject of the work is a group of women who practice “square” or “plaza” dancing in the neighbourhood. The tradition has roots in both ancient and modern Chinese history, and is a popular exercise routine performed to music in squares, plazas and parks around the world. These local performances have been a consistent scene in the otherwise rapidly changing community of Cedar Cottage. The sessions occur most mornings in the tennis courts at Brewers Park, at the Cedar Cottage Community House, or other nearby locations. The sculpture depicts one of these dancers, Koco, in six poses, each pose distinct but merging into one another, atop a square base. The sculpture was produced using 3D scanning and printing technology to capture the dancer and her movements before the final bronze form.;Sculpture;In place;;Victoria Drive & Stainsbury Avenue;Silicon Bronze, Stainless Steel;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=841;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/abf0b2e0e4817a2876d6782e3f485ae4;Privately owned;;On private property fronting Stainsbury Ave;"{""type"": ""Point"", ""coordinates"": [-123.065966, 49.252076]}";Kensington-Cedar Cottage;Koco, Brewers Park, August 11, 2019, 2020 was commissioned by Strand Development as part of their participation in the City of Vancouver's Public Art Program for Private Development.;580;Rachel Topham;2020

727;Underneath Main and Terminal and extending back towards present-day Clark Drive existed a biologically rich lagoon and marsh area that was used by the Tsleil-Waututh, Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish) and xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) Nations since time immemorial. The area was covered over to make room for Industry and the CPR railway. The attempted erasure of the space by the colonial forces of the time was thorough and it continues to be built upon today. When looking at some of the public art in Vancouver and other cities we often see a romantic depiction of industrial beginnings and labour. What existed before is often covered and ignored. Knowing that my work will live in this space temporarily I feel it is important to acknowledge its history as well as its present-day. Vancouver is built upon unceded land, sacred sites, complex river and stream systems, hunting and cultivated gathering grounds. It is easy to get lost in the feeling of permanence that urban structures hold. The areas we walk, drive and live upon have place-names and a history of lived experiences.I have lived in Vancouver on and off for around 17 years. Since moving here I have been trying to understand my relationship with this place. I am of mixed Coast Salish ancestry (Klahoose and Sliammon) from my grandmother Agnes Pielle, as well as Wuikinuxv and Kwakwaka'wakw from my grandfather Johnny Hanuse. As a youth I learned that my Grandmother's Nations were historically unified with the Nations here and visually our iconography shares links. The relationship between Nations experienced rupture as a result of colonization. Visually it is important for me to work in continuum with my ancestors. It is also important for me to note that these images do not represent the space they will temporarily live upon, but reflect a relationship and respect for the land and water that my ancestors carried.

736;The artwork responds to the architectural and cultural context of the VPLʼs new nəә́ca̓ ʔmat ct Strathcona Branch Library. It aims to highlight a sense of community despite visible economic and cultural diversity of the neighbourhood. The form is inspired by animals from the Strathcona neighbourhood, the historical precedent of narrative bronze doors in relief, and the phenomenon of “Head in the Hole” photo boards. Conceptually, it responds to the colour and texture in the community (particularly the murals), and the desire to identify oneself as part of a community. Bronze doors are heavy and have a ceremonial quality. Often covered in narrative reliefs, they are an early form of storytelling. What is the narrative here at the Library? The name, nəә́ca̓ ʔmat ct, loosely translates as “we are one” in the Musqueam language, and the artwork responds to this sentiment. Introducing animals into the artwork is a way to identify all the library patrons as “one” across a loose geographic area without picking out and representing cultural differences which, while is important to celebrate diversity, becomes tricky when it becomes a symbol of ownership and belonging. We all have an innate desire see ourselves in the world around us and understand that we belong somewhere. Through identifying with a character, a cultural symbol or in the capturing of a moment that contains us (the selfie), we place ourselves within acertain context. The artwork takes the form of ʻHead in holeʼ photo board to create a situation in which people of all ages can simultaneously identify with a character/animal, and see themselves within it. It is a sculptural activation of the imaginative process involved in reading. The holes provide the opportunity to see yourself in the mirror as the animal from a distance, or they invite you to peer inside.;Relief;In place;VPL n???c?a?mat ct Strathcona Branch Library;730 East Hastings Street;Bronze and 1 way mirror;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=736;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/534c5d3a02691ac061bd361deee626c0;City of Vancouver;Strathcona;Artwork is located in the front lobby on both sides of the wall area to the left of the front doors.;"{""type"": ""Point"", ""coordinates"": [-123.088927, 49.281065]}";Strathcona;All my favorite people are Animals is a sliding door panel made of cast bronze that sits in front of a one‐way mirror.

During the residency the artist has translated and examined over 700 letters and artifacts from his late mother Suk-Fong Wong, using them as a source of inspiration to realize workshops, performances, and artworks in photography, video, and sculpture including this neon work. The letters and artworks were presented as part of his exhibition “淑芳你好嘛 /Suk-Fong Nay Ho Mah / Suk-Fong, How Are You?” at Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden in 2019, and provided an account of China’s shifting cultural and political landscapes told through the personal perspectives of Wong’s family, offering a unique understanding of China’s transformation in the late-twentieth century.Saltwater City Vancouver/鹹水埠温哥华 is a Public Art project commissioned by the City of Vancouver Public Art Program in partnership with Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden, and is supported by The Prospero Group and the Audain Art Foundation.;344;City of Vancouver;2020
847;"In the grand scheme of Vancouver’s heritage, the neon period from 1925 to 1960 is perhaps the city’s most heralded example of its transition from gloomy sawmill town to vibrant metropolis. At the peak of this glowing epoch there were thousands of electrified gas filled glass tubes in the Terminal City’s neon jungle. A big hiccup in this brightlights-big-city story came with the blackouts of WWII when civil defence restrictions lead to a new category of no neon outdoor advertising known as “Spectaculars.”When McGavin’s Bakery approached Neon Products for an animated neon of Mother Hubbard’s bread, a “Spectacular” was suggested instead. A hand of enormous proportions was proposed, roughly the same size as the Statue of Liberty’s, but instead of grasping the eternal flame of freedom, Mother Hubbard’s digits would raise on high a leviathan loaf of liberty bread! Genius! McGavin’s, a big supporter of Victory Bonds, approved.Ironically, work on the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf didn’t begin until after blackout restrictions had been lifted at the end of the war. Progress slowed when McGavin’s roof required fortification supporting the added weight. Then the “Spectacular” installers were unavailable, preoccupied by a Log Cabin Cookies billboard featuring a real log cabin with smoking chimney and Mom inside whipping up maple creams. Finally in September 1948, the “Spectacular” crew convened on the roof of McGavin’s and over the next four months assembled the sheet metal loaf and concrete mixed with vermiculite hand, and a cuff hiding the steel bridgework. The finished Giant Hand &amp; Loaf stood atop McGavin’s bakery from 1949 through 1973.When Henri Robideau photographed the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf in February 1973, its cuff had blown away in a wind storm and one of its fingers had rotted off. This image became the first in his life-long photographic study of humanity’s attraction to bigness, a new science he called Gianthropology. He conducted Gianthropological Digs along the Pacific cordillera throughout the 1970’s, culminating in the 1980 exhibition Giant Things, featuring the Giant Hand &amp; Loaf as its signature image. Expanding on that huge success he launched the Pancanadienne Gianthropological Survey, portaging around Canada in the 1980’s, photographing the monumental in the form of panoramic images.";Two-dimensional artwork;In place;CBC Vancouver Broadcast Centre Plaza;700 Hamilton Street;Digital print on vinyl;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=847;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/f396dc57ea3b3baf9855a9a67d03008a;Vancouver Heritage Foundation;Downtown;On the wall to the right of the main entrance of CBC Vancouver.;"{""type"": ""Point"", ""coordinates"": [-123.114234, 49.279663]}";Downtown;THE WALL is a Vancouver Heritage Foundation public art initiative.

863;"Gaslight is a neon sign with the word &ldquo;gaslight&rdquo; written in glowing block letters, circled by the outline of a flickering gas flame. The name is a pun on the nature of neon, as literally light made from gas.

The design of the sign was inspired by the title card for the 1940 film Gaslight. With the film&rsquo;s success, the term &quot;gaslighting&quot; was adopted in psychology to refer to a form of abuse in which the victim is covertly manipulated into doubting their own memory, perception, judgement, and eventually their sanity. More recently this term has been used to describe the manipulation of an entire society through misinformation and destabilizing the concept of truth. 

In the current context fractured by a global public health pandemic, the inequalities of late capitalism, the violence of systemic racism, and a looming catastrophic climate crisis, the term &quot;gaslighting&quot; has re-emerged as a powerful signifier and imminent warning of the gap between perception and reality.";Site-integrated work;In place;Del Mar Inn;555 Hamilton Street;White neon;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=863;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/49edd1448ed2431cea8b44149093e8be;Privately owned;Downtown;Northeast roofline of the Del Mar Inn;"{""type"": ""Point"", ""coordinates"": [-123.112298, 49.281596]}";Downtown;"A neon artwork mounted on the roofline of the Del Mar Inn.

In September of 1968, Douglas Brown, a Vancouver lawyer, talked to sculptor Elek Imredy about his desire to commission a sculpture inspired by the famous Copenhagen mermaid, which could be sited on the great granite boulder just off the northern shore of Stanley Park. Imredy proposed a life-size bronze sculpture of a scuba diver. On Brown's initiative, the Vancouver Harbour Improvement Society was formed with the intention of financing and facilitating a unique landmark for both Vancouverites and visitors to the city. They raised the money to produce the sculpture privately and Imredy was commissioned to craft the proposed work. The Vancouver Park Board gave permission to the society to place the sculpture on the rock. Because the boulder was often covered at high tide, a precast concrete ring was created and the rock was lifted by a floating crane and set on the ring about 100 feet from its original location.  Imredy first took a mold of the top surface of the rock. In his studio, he made a replica of the rock and modeled the figure in clay. Imredy asked his young friend Debra Harrington to model, however the sculpture is not recognizably her image. ""When I couldn't get the model to hold her hand the way I wanted it... I held my left hand in front of a mirror, showing its opposite, and I modeled   right one. Of course, I made it a bit nicer, with longer fingers."" A plaster of paris mold was made from the clay figure and the sculpture was cast in fibreglass. This fibreglass figure was flown to Rome where it was cast in bronze at Giovanni and Angelo Nicci's foundry. On June 9th, 1972, the sculpture was set in place by an electric crane reaching out from shore to the rock 8o feet away and fastened to the stone with stainless steel bolts. The next day the sculpture was ceremoniously unveiled. ""Girl in Wetsuit"" has become a landmark for visitors to Stanley Park and to boats that enter the harbour.";79;;1972

110;"The parameters for the juried competition operated by Parks Canada were to create ""a monument in Vanier Park to commemorate Captain George Vancouver,"" the first European to sail into Burrard Inlet, in 1792. The competition guidelines (1979) specified a sculpture made of permanent materials, ""not wood,"" and that it should not be in the likeness of a man. The form of the work takes off from two 18th century navigational instruments: the plane table and David's quadrant.  Chung Hung said that, ""The objective of the sculpture is to create a symbolic image with definite visual expression, awakening an awareness in Captain George Vancouver's contribution to the world, his remarkable and meticulous surveys which included the north Pacific coast."" The piece frames English Bay from the north view and the Centennial Museum from the south view. The opportunity for a sculpture was offered to the city by Hugh Faulkner, Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs at the time. The project was recommended by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.  A five-member jury headed by former parks superintendent Stuart Lefeaux selected Chung Hung's proposal from a local competition and the Parks Board approved the choice. Gordon Smith, a member of the selection panel, said that ""If people think Hung's sculpture is a poor catch, they should have seen the ones that got away.""

165;"It took nearly eight years for this monument to come into being. A committee was formed in conjunction with Capilano College and a subsequent national competition drew 98 entries. Toronto artist Beth Alber won with the design incorporating 14 pink granite benches in a circle.  It stands as a reminder of violence against women in society.  The competition policies state that, ""The Women's Monument is conceived as a rational monument to be located in Vancouver, BC, dedicated to all women who have been murdered by men, and naming the 14 women killed in Montreal on Dec 6,1989. It will provide a focus for healing and a tangible symbol of remembrance."" Beth Alber's artist proposal states,  ""The circle, the symbol used by women for centuries to represent a continuum, in a non-hierarchical way, is one of the major elements for this Women's Monument. It is a symbol of women's spirit and is associated with the idea of a protected or consecrated space.""  During the course of the project, considerable controversy was stirred up by the wording of the inscription which is dedicated to ""all women who have been murdered by men"".  Many people felt this inscription was too political. Some were critical about the eventual cost of the monument, approximately $500,000, which they felt could have been put to better purpose.  Many felt that the monument was too specific and was inappropriately sited in a public place, and that public money shouldn't be used to commemorate what was construed to be a private grief. But despite the obstacles, ""Marker of Change"" was unveiled in Thornton Park on December 6th, 1997 exactly eight years after the 14 women were killed.";Site-integrated work;In place;Thornton Park;Main Street & Terminal;Pink granite;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=165;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/f055679e2b17749c3364a2c16a4fe891;;Strathcona;Central area in front of the bus terminal;"{""type"": ""Point"", ""coordinates"": [-123.099, 49.27401]}";Strathcona;"The monument consists of a 100' diameter circle of 14 pink granite benches each 5.5' long with a slight bowl in the top.

204;"A library is an ordered resource for accessing information to further one's knowledge and to enhance one's learning. The route taken to that information can guide the thought process and determine the end conclusions. Leonardo realized this a few centuries ago; Our concept is to challenge users of the facility to rethink their thought processes. 
The most opportune time to accomplish this is before entering the Library - confronting the viewer by having them walk through the piece - and perhaps encouraging them to leave their previous perceptions at the door.
The format in presenting the concept is another Leonardo da Vinci exercise - a geometric discovery of form, mathematics and order. Our interpretation of the exercise challenges the viewer's perceptions: first, by engaging the individual in a visual puzzle that defines the various elements of the geometry in a manner that also juggles their perceptions; and secondly, by making visual references to the cosmos that will take the viewer beyond the physical piece to consider the mysteries of the mind, universe, and of course, the search for truth.

(A group called Britiannia Neighbours formed to organize a public design process and to fundraise for the park.) During the design process there were a number of ideas related ot water, none of which turned out to be feasible. Therefore, a symbolic representation was proposed - a mosaic creek. The intent was to involve as many community members as possible in making an art project which whould symbolize the notion of contributing one's individual expression and at the same time being part of a larger whole. There was no official theme or requirements except material specifications, I.e., frost-proof tile, type of glue, and spacing of tiles for grout allowance during installation.

At the top of the pole, a human sits on the head of Eagle-Person, a crest said to have been taken by a family on its ancient migration from Hagwilget country to Kitwancool.  In a lake they saw a large human being with an eaglelike head, wearing a headdress of grizzly bear claws that had water lily leaves around it: all these became crests.

The carving on the pole depicts this supernatural being with an eaglelike  head, human arms holding a frog, wings carved with human  heads, and legs that end in clawed feet.  The outspread wings are an unusual feature for a 'Ksan pole.

Beneath is Grizzly Bear of the Sea; the two dorsal fins signify its marine affiliation.  Variations in Sea Bear crests for this area also have three fins, or one fin with a carved face on it.

The Gitksan have a story similar to the Haida's Nanasimget story, in which Whale abducts a man's wife.

A lone Watchman sits atop four rings, called ""chief's rings"" by the carver.  ""Each ring,"" he said, ""had to be earned by the owner through some special undertaking or major commitment.""  Beneath the rings, Raven appears in his traditional duality - as bird and as human, with the latter crouched between the ears of Bear, who holds Frog before him.  These are two separate crests carved in combination.

Bear's feet rest on the head of the supernatural Mountain Hawk.  ""He's always shown with both a recurved beak and a mouth with many teeth.  It is a crest of my family,"" the carver said.

Also belonging to the Muldoe family is a very old crest known as Halfway Out, seen at the base of the pole.  The origin of this goes back to the war expedition of the warrior Naeqt against the Kitimat people of the coast.  In the early 1920s, his great-grandson gave an account of the gruesome event to Canadian anthropologist Marius Barbeau: ""Naeqt started on the warpath against Kitimat.  On his way down, he came upon a camp, wherein a man sat by himself.  He took his knife and cut the man through the middle almost in two halves, so strong was he.  The wounded man ran into the lake and stood in the water up to his ribs.""  The name and the crest Halfway Out were derived from this incident and brought back by the warrior.";109;;1990

428;"The ambition was to place an autonomous work into the chaos of downtown, with its traffic lights, signage, newspaper boxes, street lamps and traffic, that could sit independently from all of that - an anomalous and allusive object that would create its own context and exist on its own terms amidst the downtown swirl and still belong, while strongly suggesting otherness. In other words to be both part of yet separate from the surrounding architectural reality.

The references are many yet suggest nothing to anchor the sculpture into a specific interpretation. The black and white bands of stone may recall 12th century Italian church architecture. The gold leafed spheres with the projecting necks are suggestive of the retorts of the medieval alchemists whose putative ambition was to transmute lead into gold. The gold forms also suggest the popular symbols of the male and female. In addition the tower or column elevates the gold objects and, by making them inaccessible, enhances their mystery. 

Resting lightly on the column in spite of their considerable mass, the scale and precarious position of the spheres imply the possibility of arrival from some unknown place and time to briefly alight before moving on - a suggestion of a mind or consciousness, of the anthropomorphic? Or the kinetic potential of a bird that briefly alights on a rooftop before flying on.

The placing of real gold - which one usually finds in the sanctity of the church, in museums, or bank vaults - into the public realm is a means of acknowledging that there can be riches for public pleasure, treasure above ground for the eye to see and the spirit to ponder; a recognition that public art is, in every sense, an honouring of and a gifting to the community.";Sculpture;In place;Cielo - Hastings and Bute (1205 W Hastings);1205 West Hastings Street;Marble and gold leafed aluminum;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=428;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/a1f0b79f0df38f782190e43984f0698b;Privately owned;Downtown;Northwest corner of Hastings and Bute;;;;221;;2008
430;"Riding high among the rooftops in Vancouver is an unusual sight that awaits the casual viewer looking upward from street to sky; a 58 inch-high bright copper sculpture of a historical-looking figure riding a lively horse with a ringleted mane, reading a book while sitting backwards. The figure faces the direction of the wind as indicated by the four directionals and the tipped arrow upon which it rests. Closer investigation reveals this to be Rodney Graham’s Weathervane sculpture, which depicts the artist dressed as 16th Century humanist and classical scholar, Erasmus. Absorbed in the solitary activity of reading, the figure is lost in thought and contemplation, not having to worry about where he is going or what lies ahead but, as Rodney Graham puts it, is able to ‘ponder on horseback’  moving forward but also looking backward, to the past.  Rodney Graham based the weathervane on a contemporary anecdote which claimed that Erasmus wrote his most well-known work, The Praise of Folly, on horseback during a journey from Italy to England circa 1510. Graham plays on the absurdism inherent in reading a philosophical treatise on human folly whilst riding on a horse backwards and continues his ongoing philosophical enquiry into cyclical and backward movement; like all his work it contains a complex narrative and is brimful of references: literary, philosophical, self-referential and art historical.  Rodney Graham’s poetic and humourous weathervane, helpfully indicating wind direction and compass points for any serious traveller who looks upward to contemplate the conditions for travel, continues his preoccupation with un-urgent journeying. Erasmus travels from Italy to England leisurely by horseback, the cowboy meanders gently off the beaten track, the buccaneer’s unknown voyage which has thrown him up on a “treasure island”, and the chemically-induced mental journeys that take place in the artist’s head, remind us even if we are not going anywhere in particular that ‘the trip is the thing’.

The intention was to create an iconic sculpture acting as a gateway marker defining the entrance to the City of Vancouver. turn acts as an identifier of place, creating an image in the viewer’s mind that connects them back to the site.

This public artwork is inspired by Old Faithful and other natural water spouts arising from geological pressures under the earth’s surface. 

A natural geyser is a spectacle that brings attention to what is going on below the surface of things. As a public monument, Geyser for Hillcrest Park replicates this sense of wonder and acts as a spontaneous reminder of underlying forces at work on the site. It is a civic “natural wonder” that makes the green initiatives of the building apparent for all to see. It is not a fountain that operates with a recycling pump. The Geyser acts according to the rhythms and needs of the community, as evidenced by the levels and flow of water through the site. The geyser spray is around 15 feet in height. The duration of the spray is determined by the amount of water needed to fill the tank. The run-off from the Geyser is connected to the grey water cistern in the Hillcrest facility. This cistern is used for all the building’s non-potable water needs, including flushing toilets and irrigation throughout the park grounds. The cistern is fed by collected rainwater from the roof and some grey water from underground sources. However, when the water in the cistern is low, it draws on the city’s drinkable water supply. This is where the Geyser comes in. It is incorporated into this water “loop"" so that clean potable water needed to top up the cistern will first be propelled out through the Geyser and then flow back to the cistern as grey water.";"345;411";Blaine Campbell;2012

Uncomfortable when used by only one person, the artwork is best experienced with another person and thus becomes a tool for whimsical social exchange.SeeSawSeat is built with the fulcrum of the bench slighly to one side, so that when then bence is unoccupied, it drops to one side, a clear sign that it is not a fixed bench. The highest point of teh 8-foot-long bench is approximately 28"" above grade when fully tilted.SeeSawSeat was one of three public art projects developed through the Main Street Urban Transportation Showcase (UTS), a plan to encourage reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and more energy efficient transportation practices by improving pedestrian and transit services along Main Street. As part of the Main Street UTS, an art plan was created which led to the commissioning of three public art projects to be installed in the Main Street corridor, including temporary artworks for three Main Street articulated trolley buses.

655;"""I remember growing up and seeing photos of redwood stumps in northern California, photos in which, “Wow! You can drive a car right through it!” I remember always thinking of what an affront to nature it was to use a car as a standard of bigness, but that was the early twentieth century. Later in the century, in 1995, I was in Ireland and phoning home for voicemail messages and had one from my mother that said, “Hi Dear, Constable So-and-so from the Vancouver Police phoned to ask if you’d deliberately left your VW parked inside the Hollow Tree in Stanley Park before you left and, to be honest, with you we never know, so could you give him a ring?” My car had been stolen from an underground parkade and abandoned in the tree by joyriders.
 
    In 2006 Stanley Park’s Hollow Tree, an 800-year-old Western red cedar stump, was damaged in a particularly bad storm, and the City of Vancouver made a stab at removing it. I don’t know what they were thinking. Everyone in the city went crazy. The Hollow Tree is where people had their grad photos taken. It’s where they had their first kiss; it’s where everybody takes their relatives from overseas. In 2009 the Hollow Tree Conservation Society, funded entirely by private donations, stabilized the tree, and in October 2011 it was restored as well as possible, and made open to the public. I was pretty supportive of this project but years later I’m looking at the tree and I can see its days are numbered. It’s a piece of dead wood hundreds of years old. It’s rotting. It’s nature. So I wondered, “Why not transform the tree? Why not put it through a mirror and have it come out the other side as a mythical entity?” This is what I did with the Golden Tree at the corner of SW Marine Drive and Cambie Street. It’s a mirror of something that once was — and will still be for a little while — and it establishes the existence of an evolving city that has an evolving sense of nature and ecosystems. It’s also located at the Canada Line Station, and I realize for many people coming to Vancouver, they’ll see the Golden Tree before they see the Hollow Tree, as if reading the chapters in a book in the wrong order, and isn’t that life?""";Sculpture;In place;;8018 - 8198 Cambie;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=655;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/90975f329f2a9d214762e078a4b12c13;City of Vancouver;South Cambie;Corner of SW Marine Drive and Cambie Street;;;;391;photo credit not available;2016

1;"A new city hall and a statue of Captain George Vancouver were commissioned to commemorate Vancouver's Golden Jubilee in 1936. The architect of the new City Hall at Strathcona Park on West 12th Avenue, Fred Townley, proposed the sculpture, commissioned by the Vancouver Canadian Club, be placed on the plaza on the north side of the building. Noted BC sculptor, Charles Marega, was commissioned (for about $5500) to create a life-size sculpture of the man who mapped the harbour in 1792 and after whom the city is named. 
Marega began by setting up 500 pounds of clay on a turntable in his Hornby Street Studio. From the clay model, he made a plaster cast which was then used to cast the finished work in ""Roman bronze"". It was cast at Ornamental Bronze, a foundry in Vancouver. The work was installed on August 20, 1936.The bronze figure standing atop the granite plinth is said to bear little physical resemblance to Captain George. The sculpture was copied from a maquette, which had been fashioned after a painting that was in turn, a copy from an original painting.
An interesting conversation is recorded between Major Matthews, the City Archivist, and Townley. 
Matthews: ""Mr. Townley, the ""Sun"" newspaper wants to know how much the Vancouver statue cost and who paid for it.""
Townley: ""What do they want to bring that up for? Leave sleeping dogs lie. I've been afraid that matter would come up, but it has not...why bring it up now? It was all in the contract; everything was above board; there's nothing to hide; but if it gets out what it cost, then some fool will start writing to the newspapers, or something, and complain of the waste of money; say it ought to have been given towards the support of some fool scheme of his own, the ""home for incurable dogs"", or some other idiotic thing"".
Matthews: ""Alright; drop it, I don't want to know; the ""Sun"" is publishing a story on the statue, and I suppose they want to put the cost in.""
Townley: ""Well, Charles Marega made it, and baby bonds paid for it...I don't know exactly what it cost; it would be hard to find out; part of it was in the stone work cost. Marega for $5000, and then there was the base; so much per square foot for the base, perhaps $500 for that...""
The statue was cleaned in 2001, 65 years after its installation and in time for the city's 115th birthday. The bill for cost of cleaning was $5800, almost the same amount as the original statue cost. This sculpture is on the City of Vancouver's Heritage Inventory list and, as a proud homage to a great explorer, has stood the test of time.";Figurative;In place;Vancouver City Hall;453 West 12th Avenue;bronze;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=1;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/6dfd36260587f27540709ca506c4e81c;City of Vancouver;Mount Pleasant;North entrance, exterior, in front of stairs;"{""type"": ""Point"", ""coordinates"": [-123.113918, 49.261185]}";Mount Pleasant;A full figure bronze statue of Captain George Vancouver stands on the north side of City Hall, pointing towards Vancouver harbour and holding a partially open scroll in his left hand.

65;"The project, for me, was about space for public use where art would help shape, animate and give meaning to that space.

One of the underlying references is the many streams that once flowed into False Creek. The extension of the pavement above the water’s edge is meant to suggest this disappearance underground, to stir memory and history, while at the same time reinforcing the sense of the above ground space as a visually continuous promenade and plaza.

The pond’s dominant feature, a circular granite sculpture sited in the center of the pond, is elevated above the grade of the paving so that a viewer (pedestrian or resident) can fully comprehend its form: a form that might suggest a flower, a wheel, a saw blade....This sculpture also has a spatial function to gather and hold energy as well as operating as a source of water for the pond. The three granite rings embedded in the concrete plaza reiterate the central well of the sculpture from which the water flows and activate the plaza plane. This plane is further activated by the stainless steel rings that echo both the shape of the pond ends as well as the wave movement of the water.

The design of the rocket ship looks like a 1950s Hollywood movie space ship. The design was originally created in 1936 for the Sheet Metal Workers Local 280 float for the Pacific National Exhibition Jubilee Parade on the occasion of the City of Vancouver's 50th birthday. It was designed by Lew Parry and made into a sculpture, built by Neon Products, which was sited at the first Vancouver Air Terminal from 1939 to 1972 when it was scrapped because of rust. In 1985 the Vancouver Transportation Club and the Sheet Metal Workers Union 280 decided to build a replica to celebrate Vancouver's 100th birthday. They located Lew Parry and he still had the original plans. This time the rocketship was built from more durable materials by Terminal Sheet Metal and the Local 280 metal workers. The Rocket was exhibited at Expo 86 and then donated to the city. It was moved by helicopter to it's current site. A Centennial Time Capsule is housed in the base of the rocket, scheduled to be opened 50 years from 1986. It includes items such as an Expo 86 passport with stamps of all the pavilions and recorded messages from local celebrities and many other things.
The City accepted the Centennial Rocket and a site was found for it in the small plaza at the SW end of the Cambie Street bridge.  -information from the website of SMW280";115;Lilli Wong;1986

The birth of the mechanical clock circa 1,000 AD was a technological innovation that, as Lewis Mumford pointed out in ""Technics and Civilization"" made possible the mechanical clock as a simile for his paradigm of the workings of nature, a paradigm cited in recent years as contributing to the world's current ecological state: hence the ""ruins"" of a clock face. 
Yet what is watered grows; thus even an ancient ruins can initiate new life, as the unearthing of sculpture from an ancient Greece was seminal in issuing forth that springtime in Italy known as the Renaissance. This is not a fountain of youth but of time, old time reborn in the ever flowing spring of records of human endeavour.
With the advent of the millenium at hand, reflections on the passing of time increase. The numbers observable in Fountain of Time (five, six, seven) reflect a countdown to the millenium: '95, '96 '97. In this context the fountain is a portrait of a certain reality of our time. Yet this particular reality (that of the twentieth century drawing to a close, and what that brings to mind), is only one of many many realities, relevent to those following the Gregorian calendar rather than for example the Islamic, Tibetan or Mayan calendars.

The lights, which are at grade level, define constellations in the night sky. The colorful swirls represent other galaxies and deep space objects, and the boats allude both to the actual cargo ships found in Vancouver's harbour and to mankind's use of the stars as navigation tools.     
Kerr's sculpture was commissioned by the developer of the site after a competition sanctioned by the Vancouver Public Art Committee. It has been integrated into the public plaza/walkway that runs diagonally through the site from the corner of Alberni and Broughton to the corner of Jervis and Georgia.
The work addresses pedestrian traffic through the walkway both during the day and as a completely different experience at night. It also allows opportunities for viewing the work from above from suites in the towers and from neighbouring towers.
""Milky Way"" has four elements layered into the work. The first is 39 colorful mosaic spiral galaxies scattered across the site. The brilliantly colorful mosaic tiles stand in marked contrast to the second element, colored stone aggregate which has been laid down in large abstract fiels and which represent the ""cosmic sea"". The third element is 170 fibre optic point lights, in four different intensities, which represent the stars in 36 constellations. These ""stars"" are each set into a black granite star shaped tile and each constellation is further defined by lines of polished brass set into the aggregate. The last element is three large bronze castings of cargo ships, commonly seen in Vancouver's harbour - a fishing trawler, a tug and gravel barge, and a BC ferry - all seen from above.
This work is both public and private, it welcomes both day and night viewing (in some sense providing its own light), and it enhances both public space and the developer's concerns for place making and site harmony. ""Milky Way"" is a successful example of Vancouver's public art program which has emphasized ""site specific"" public art instead of traditional sculpture.";51;Colin Goldie;1999

After being fabricated out of silicon bronze by the Harman Foundry in Sechelt, BC, Time Top was submerged into the ocean water at Gibsons, BC for two years. While submerged, it was connected to an electrical power supply which delivered a low voltage charge to the bronze causing it to attract a deposition of seawater minerals on to it’s surface forming a crust. This process is known as “Electro-deposition of minerals in seawater” or accretion. When the accretion process was complete,
the sculpture was fitted with a polycarbonate dome and now stands 13 feet tall and 10 feet wide. A series of granite cap stones, inscribed with images from the original comic strip, have been installed along the sea wall in front of the sculpture.

Spanning four stories of the building, Double Blind  translates a Snellen, or eye, chart into Braille by using dome mirrors in order to emulate the raised dots of Braille script.

Dome mirrors are endemic to public spaces and can be found in pedestrian underpasses, hospital corridors, and in commercial retail contexts. They are used for surveillance as well as for the prevention of collisions in pedestrian traffic flow. Public space is often highly contested since it must typically answer to the idealist demands of communal space while also satisfying the concerns for public safety that are frequently associated with control and surveillance. Like many atriums, the new Vancouver Community College’s interior public space has a panoptic tendency: emphasizing ‘insight’ into various interior spaces from specific vantage points. This panoptic tendency is echoed in the domed mirrors, each reflecting a 360° view of the surrounding space.

Double Blind deliberately and emphatically utilizes elements that are commonly found in public space and re-purposes them, thereby highlighting the quality of the space itself, rather than offering a pictorial escape from its reality. Double Blind queries the interlinked ideas of seeing and controlling, acknowledging the importance of the context in which information is acquired and processed, whether that context is a scientific doctrine, social matrix, or language system.

This sculptural work is accompanied by a T-shirt multiple that echoes the installation’s oxymoronic premise: those who can see the work likely don’t read braille, and those who read braille can probably not see the work.

On the back of each T-shirt, an eye chart is rendered in raised letters. Though reproduced in a colour identical to that of the shirt and thereby nearly invisible, the characters are tangible. Conversely, the front of each shirt mirrors the installation’s graphic arrangement in reflective foil, yet these braille dots are entirely two-dimensional, visible, but not available through touch.";317;Photo Technic;2008
438;"Thrust into the waters of Burrard Inlet, The Drop playfully invites the viewer to reflect on our relationship with this precious commodity of water, and by extension, on the history, complexity, and future of our waterfront.

The Drop pays homage to the element of water and the un-tameable forces of nature which are omnipresent in Vancouver.  The slender, elongated sculpture balances as if a huge raindrop were on the verge of landing on the sea walk.

Although the sculpture takes a natural phenomenon as its starting point, it displays a technical perfection, artificially coloured to correspond to the sky and contrasting with the pale yellow mass of the mountain of sulphur visible on the horizon, waiting to be loaded into cargo ships.

The sculpture’s angle and orientation create a visual dialogue with the architecture of the Convention Centre West, as well as with the bows of the gigantic cruise ships frequently docked nearby.

453;"My pieces are about concerns which play an important role in everyday life as well as in art, in painting, sculpture, architecture: space—movement—time—light. My pieces are not about that what we see, not about that what appears in front of our eyes but about that what is behind them, about that what presupposes seeing. My pieces in the urban environment, in a building or in the outer space do not exist without contact to their surroundings. They exist in a social and local context. This context is defined by the architectural surrounding, the architectural idea and the social situation: the co-operation of different historic, functional, organizational, visual, acoustic, tactile, communicative moments.

The conditions of perception, orientation, movement and communication determine my thoughts about the situation and the development of an idea for the special place. So, my pieces refer to the place and the context, explore existing rooms, architecture, places, situations with different medias and react to the specific parameters of the surroundings:  the place—the situation—the function. On the other hand everyday moments and social connections play a role. I am interested in the specific site that the work exists in. My intention has been to change the nature of the public space. This space altered by my input, becomes the art. 

Light is my most preferred media I deal with because of its special quality. Light is a basic element. Without light there is no life. Besides, light is a very changeable element: Actually light—daylight and artificial light—exists in endlessly different versions. And light is a very ephemeral element; that's why I like it.

502;"This work was commissioned by Reliance Properties. The desire was to have an integrated light art work on the concrete cores of the two towers that would set apart the building and at the same time relate to its surroundings.

The idea for the light installation was inspired by the natural surroundings.The city skyline holds a spectacular backdrop of mountains and water. But the work also responds to the architecture of the building which is constructed of glass all the way around apart from the concrete core. The two towers are connected by a lower section between them. The building is not rectangular but instead protrudes at different angles drawing diagonal lines in the glass facade. These angles can be seen as mountain peaks and they became the starting point for the light design. Led light lines were mounted on the concrete core horizontally. The lines reveal 40 different preset modes which have been uploaded to the rgb modules. One state is a graphic pattern of a single angle that meets up with angle of the building representing the sihouette of a mountain. This image remains the same but the colors change very gradually. The flow of the colors was inspired by the changes of the seasons and the changes of the day. They blend into each other with fades making the transitions look natural as part of the environment. The graphic state is sometimes intercepted by a dynamic state where a motion is simulated of water running down the building.

526;"""Southwest and Southeast Marine drive has always loomed in my mind as Vancouver’s spookiest strip. Since childhood, every time I’ve driven down it, I’ve been creeped out by the scary 1930s and 1940s industrial structures to the south — by the endless repetitive loop of fast food and dead underwatered lawns, and by its overabundance of appallingly cheap commercial architecture. In my mind, when children die, their ghosts went to work inside those scary brick buildings. Inside the fast food joints, the fare was probably saltier and greasier than anywhere else, and if you went into one of the businesses or professional buildings, cults would hand you religious pamphlets, and when you left, your clothing would smell like your grandmother’s front hall cupboard and a moldy copy of Life magazine with Pat Nixon on the cover.

I’ve been watching the strip’s ongoing redevelopment over the past decade, and while I’m glad it’s finally changing, I’ve been slightly unsure of what it’s changing into. The stores are now big and clean and shiny and no longer coma inducing — but maybe every time you buy something there, a penguin dies in Antarctica or a tree is chopped down up north, never to be replanted? Well, that’s just me being morbid. It’s now actually much better than it was before — the air of unipolar depression is gone — replaced by the early 21st century’s version of perfected retail, that of inventory-optimized big box shopping. The city has also kept what little good architecture there was and is making a definite attempt to green the place up. So when it came time to think of something for this location, I thought, ‘Why not revel in the consumer fantasia that is the Big Box?’  To do something earnest or minimal in the way that we expect public art to be seemed like a defeatist strategy. Anything sparse or overly cerebral would be optically clubbed to death by a staggering amount of colorful signage, and a chance to say something exciting or uplifting about the place would be lost in a possible miasma of jargon and Corten steel slabs.

Canadian Tire is a store about possibilities; we all know the wonderful sense of creative omnipotence we feel walking down the aisles: Oh, the things I could do with those slats! And why, are those thin-veneer doors useful as tabletops? And look! An eight-can paint-shaker! We know the smell of fertilizer, plywood and galvanized nails. And we most of all know the smell of rubber tires — the smell of long-chain carbon molecules off-gassing in a way that no ventilation system can ever fight. And in Canadian Tire, the rubber you smell is possibly a Motomaster whitewall, and that’s what Infinite Tire is: a Brancusi-esque expression of joy in all things suburban, a wink to the notion of better living through abundance, and a totem of sorts that acknowledges and revels in the choices and creative freedom that can be inherent in industrial sizing systems."" - Douglas Coupland, 2012";Sculpture;In place;Canadian Tire;26 South West Marine Drive;;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=526;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/4fa66f210fc77ef34bf5760d07758e8d;Privately owned;Marpole;;;;;391;Emma Peter;2012

591;"Substation Pavilion consists of a small structure constructed of board-formed Ductal concrete, steel and glass, with a door that hints at a possible entrance (although in this case it is merely a
decoy). There are windows on two sides, adding to the illusion of some kind of use value implicit to its presence on the site. The windows are utilitarian, institutional, industrial, with frosted security glass containing wire that obscure a direct line of site into the structure. Within the pavilion is a single, dim light. The pavilion sits immediately to the east of the entrance to the Meccanica development on the corner of First Avenue and Quebec Street in Vancouver, BC. The design borrows from the artdeco influenced electrical substations that are interwoven in Vancouver’s urban fabric. The piece looks as if it has been a long-term tenant of the site, as if it belongs to the area and is a relic of an earlier age. The illusion of its permanence is ruptured by a number of elements that disturb a simple and seamless inclusion in the local vernacular. The pavilion’s design references utility and yet as a consequence of the breaking up of vertical relations within the piece it becomes obvious
something else is going on. What possible use could be made of a structure that seems to have no level floor, let alone barely enough room to turn around in? Why would so much attention be paid to the design of such a small and inconsequential piece of infrastructure?
Substation Pavilion’s design hints at the networks of subterranean connections with the rest of the city and with the past of the site itself. The entire area of False Creek consisted of a marshy wetland prior to its infill. This program of ‘reclaiming’ the tidal areas of Vancouver allowed for the development of the rail yards and industrial infrastructure at the east end of False Creek. This established a horizontal approach to looking at and moving through the growing city, tied as it was to these rail lines. The vertical tendencies of this project aim to introduce the rupturing of the quotidian relationship with the horizontal that dominates movement through the city. The strata formed in the soil of the False Creek area carry the history of the settlement of the area. The networks of the rail yards spread the stories of the people passing through them,
creating layers within the cultural memory of the city. Over the years this cultural detritus molds and rots just as the soil and the structures of the area do. Together they form a humus that
contains the mold that supports life in the city, spreading underneath every structure we build and every story we tell. This is a fertile substrate, not one given to decay and destruction. It supports connections and unexpected developments, much as the rhizomorphic systems of a large fungus will remain hidden, spreading underground and only exhibiting its presence once a

597;"At once romantic and fantastic, Nail Farm seeks to reconcile the desire to satisfy city-self and country-self, the inherent drive in urban agriculture. The barn is based on a local gambrel roof barn. It is abstracted to the point where it can be seen more as a lattice system to use for the growth of plants. The implied animal stalls become the grow beds. The entire footprint of the project is covered in 2' deep growing medium and can therefore be used as a ground for
growing anything. Even the paths can potentially be overgrown.

599;"A stream once flowed here on its way to Renfrew Ravine. The City’s storm-drain still follows the path of the stream beneath us.
It flows into Still Creek where, after many decades of absence, salmon spawn again. This is a place rich with story and memory.

621;"This art project challenges the existing chromatics of downtown Vancouver. In a city known for architecture of greys, muted greens and blues, the resulting mass of construction can appear monolithic and somber at times, with only the occasional splash of colour. When these colours do occur, they seem almost jarring - too powerful and unresponsive to changes in light and weather. ""Dichroic Vancouver"" introduces a set of colour-changing bands of glass to the new Manulife Financial office building. Four delicate lines of dichroic glass are integrated into the southeast and southwest facades to bring nuances of shifting colour to viewers. The hues are affected by climatic and light modulations in the sky. Like weather and emotion, all is in a constant state of change.

hub of industry and processing, but has rapidly been
converted from a quasi-abandoned and contaminated
brownfield into a highly-designed, dense residential
neighbourhood. The word refined refers to both the
process of removing unwanted elements to create an
increasingly homogeneous and pure substance and also to
the perception of characteristics such as elegance,
sophistication, and urbanity. The artwork, Refined, draws
specifically on the forms and processes of salt purification
which used to take place in the building immediately
proximal to the site while exploring the overall
transformation of the neighbourhood itself.
The artwork is composed of five pure-white, conical
sculptures of varying heights that sit within a recessed pool
of recycled glass. During the day, the pure geometric forms
and angular shapes of the surrounding glass elements
catch and play with natural sunlight. At night, warm hued

The initial concept for the sign came from viewing large driftwood logs tossed up on rocks along the beach near the Vancouver Maritime Museum. The large horizontal cedar log was cut from a tree blown down by strong winds in Stanley Park, salvaged and donated by the City of Vancouver. The log has been set onto boulders excavated from the old Carling O'Keefe Brewery site at 12th Avenue and Arbutus, and donated by Intergulf Development Group.The vertical log sculpture is composed of 3 layers of upright logs stepping up and back from the viewer. The first carving on the front set of logs portrays a Coast Salish village with cedar plank houses and beached canoes, a scene which may have been typical around this area prior to European settlement.The carving on the second layer of logs portrays past and present roots of Kitsilano, including a traditional corner store, craftsman-style houses, adn Engine 374, which pulled the first transcontinental train into Vancouver in 1887, was retired to Kitsilano Park for many years, and is now on display in the Roundhouse Community Centre.

Woven blankets, made from the wool of mountain goats and dog hair, were often worn as garments and used in ceremonies, but also made for use in the home.Today, very near the site of this installation, at the mouth of the Fraser River, Coast Salish blanket weaving continues in the community of Musqueam, where respected and accomplished weavers continue to develop this art form.Robyn Sparrow created two of these beautiful weavings (number 1 and 2 from the left, if facing the display case along Granville Street). Her weavings incorporate traditional weaving designs that reflect the Coast Salish (Musqueam) Culture, such as Salish V’s and Waves.Krista Point created two of these beautiful weavings (number 3 and 4 from the left, if facing the display case along Granville Street). The designs she used in these 2 weavings are flying geese, zigzag design (meaning is Lightening in the sky, trail from a snake).;"168;606;607";R. Beiks;2013

812;"""Learning that a vibrant community of Black Canadians was not only tragically erased, but that their memory is nearly forgotten, comes as a harsh shock. But focusing only on the pain of this tragedy isn’t telling the complete story. Instead, I’ve become driven by how strongly the voices of triumph and hope still ring out from underneath the loss.With this piece I wish to highlight a vibrant, joyful perspective: one of hope and a future built from past remnants.Motifs of music and laughter emerge throughout the stories and memories I have encountered. The passion for rebuilding, of bringing back to Vancouver what has been lost, is particularly moving. This tribute explores growth and rebirth - our youth rediscovering their roots and communing with their forebears through whatever means available. Hogan’s Alley is a precious piece of history in dire need of remembrance and revival.

817;“The Waters are Rising” shares the legend of “The Great Flood” into the public realm. We feel this Granville Bridge South location is ideal for sharing this legend. This mural presents an Indigenous story from the cultural knowledge keepers in my extended family along the West Coast. The rope marks where the canoes were pulled up can still be seen on Mount Garibaldi and Mount Baker.This Coast Salish version shows a Thunderbird warning the people that the waters are rising. The Thunderbird resides in the sun. He is the Creator’s messenger. He helps the people on earth by warning them of oncoming events, usually of storms, but now he speaks of climate change. He is telling the people that the waters will keep rising until the people take full stewardship of precious Mother Earth. The Tyee Salmon are the knowledge keepers, and the Eulochon fish represent the learners. I have chosen this theme due to Indigenous concerns about stewardship of the land and waters, and the climate change crisis that is upon us.;Mural;In place;Granville Bridge;;Paint;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=817;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/fe046bb97d210392d0a4b4de2e1485b3;City of Vancouver;Kitsilano;1500 Blk of W 4th Avenue.

826;10 Baseball Caps is a bronze sculptural installation by Gathie Falk, commissioned for a residential development by Washington Properties at 35th Avenue and Cambie Street. It is installed in conjunction with two additional sculptures by the artist on the site: 18 Pairs of Blue and White Running Shoes and 900 Oranges. The public artworks at this site continue Falk’s devotion to keen observations of everyday objects, as well as her use of repetition, both of which have been central to her practice for over six decades.For 10 Baseball Caps, the artist produced three different papier mâché caps with slight variations which were then cast in bronze in multiples of three or four and installed in an alternating pattern in primary colours. The caps hang in a group facing downward on the column at the entrance of the building as they might inside the entrance of one’s home, bridging Falk’s explorations of domestic content with the public realm. 10 Baseball Caps bear the traces of human presence while reflecting Falk’s career-long interest in utilizing elements of clothing to explore gender, ritual and status.;Sculpture;In place;35 Park West, Building A;4963 Cambie Street;Bronze;https://covapp.vancouver.ca/PublicArtRegistry/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=826;https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/v2/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/c1ff535f19e448f560d03caa89ada330;Privately owned - Strata;Oakridge;;"{""type"": ""Point"", ""coordinates"": [-123.117951, 49.239464]}";South Cambie;10 bronze baseball caps, attached to NW face of column.;226;Maureen Smith;2019
